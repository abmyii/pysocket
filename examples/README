The example is a simple chat program where the client sends data to the server
and the server prints the data & the client addr.

To run
------
python server.py (in one console)
python client.py (in another)

client.py will ask you for the server IP (localhost works too). After you have entered it, you can
start writing text. When you press ENTER it sends the data to the server. If
you look on the server console, you will see some data printed out.
